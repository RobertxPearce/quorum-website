    "hint" : "<p>Drop the output blocks into the correct scope and create a boolean expression that calculates whether a year is a leap year. The first requirement is that the year is divisible by four. If the year mod four is zero then this first condition is met. The Second requirement is that the year is divisible by 100 or 400. Taking the same approach if the year mod 100 or 400 is equal to zero, the second condition is met.</p>",
