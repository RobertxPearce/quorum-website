To build the boolean expression for this, the year must be divisible by four and the year must be divisible by one hundred or four hundred. Use this information to add to the basic expression already in the program.</p>",

    "hint" : "<p>Drop the output blocks into the correct scope and create a boolean expression that calculates whether a year is a leap year. The first requirement is that the year is divisible by four. If the year mod four is zero then this first condition is met. The Second requirement is that the year is divisible by 100 or 400. Taking the same approach if the year mod 100 equals zero or year mod 400 equals zero, the second condition is met.</p>",
